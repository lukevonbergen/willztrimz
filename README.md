## ⚙️ Configuration

### Grid Cell Size
Default: **20m x 20m** (optimized for performance)

```javascript
// In App.jsx, addSearchAreaWithGrid()
const gridData = generateGridForArea(coordinates, 20); // Change cell size
```

Recommended range: 15m - 30m
- Smaller = more detail, slower performance
- Larger = less detail, better performance

### Simulation Speed
Configurable via UI (0.5x - 4x) or in code:

```javascript
// In hooks/useSimulation.js
const baseInterval = 3000; // milliseconds between updates
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Map tiles not loading**
- Check internet connection
- Refresh the page
- Clear browser cache

**Simulation not starting**
- Ensure at least one search area exists
- Ensure at least one officer is added
- Check that officers are marked as "active"

**Performance issues**
- Reduce number of active officers
- Use smaller search areas
- Increase grid cell size (e.g., 25m or 30m)

**LocalStorage quota exceeded**
- Export and clear old data
- Increase grid cell size
- Reduce path history retention
